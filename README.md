## Usage

### TLDR

Good Bot has two main commands, `setup` and `record`.
You **always** need to run `setup` before the `record` command
if you are working on a new project.

#### Using `setup`

First, navigate to the directory where your video script is
saved. Then, to use setup:

##### On a Unix-like system

```shell
good-bot-cli setup [script-name.yaml]
```

This should prompt you for a project name. Good Bot will then
create a new directory that contains everything required by the
`record` command.

#### Using `record`

Make sure that you are in the same directory as the directory
that you created with the `setup` command. Then, you should
be able to record your project using the following instructions.

##### On a Unix-like system

```shell
good-bot-cli record [project-name]
```

This should start recording right away. Please note that the
`[project-name]` is the name of the directory created with
`setup`, not the name of your script.

## Motivation

Before writing `good-bot-cli`, Good Bot was only distributed as a
Docker image. This allows the program to always start recording in a 
new environment with nothing installed. You won't need to manually 
uninstall every program that was installed for your demo each time
you want to record a new take.

The main problem with containerized application is that it makes file
and environment sharing between the host and the container quite
tedious.

When using Google Text to Speech and passwords at the same time, the
`record` command had to look something like this:

```shell
docker run -it -v $PWD:/project -v /home/tricky/Documents/credentials:/credentials --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/good-bot-tts.json --env-file /home/tricky/Documents/credentials/good-bot.env gb record project
```

Two hundred and sixty-six characters for a single command wasn't very reasonable.

`good-bot-cli` allows a user to interactively configure each path
towards files that are required by Good Bot. The CLI also takes
care of making the required mounts and starts the container in
interactive mode when required. Once the configuration process is
completed, `good-bot-cli` would tun the previous command to this:

```shell
good-bot-cli record project
```
