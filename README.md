## Usage

### TLDR

Good Bot has two main commands, `setup` and `record`.
You **always** need to run `setup` before the `record` command
if you are working on a new project.

#### Using `setup`

First, navigate to the directory where your video script is
saved. Then, to use setup:

##### On a Unix-like system

```shell
good-bot-cli setup [script-name.yaml]
```

This should prompt you for a project name. Good Bot will then
create a new directory that contains everything required by the
`record` command.

#### Using `record`

Make sure that you are in the same directory as the directory
that you created with the `setup` command. Then, you should
be able to record your project using the following instructions.

##### On a Unix-like system

```shell
good-bot-cli record [project-name]
```

This should start recording right away. Please note that the
`[project-name]` is the name of the directory created with
`setup`, not the name of your script.
